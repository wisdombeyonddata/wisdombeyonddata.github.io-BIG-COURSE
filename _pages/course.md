Then, we move on to talk about computers learning patterns from data. This is actually also a similar process to our own brains. Computers have a lot more computing power which can enable to see the relations between data points a lot faster than if we would have stared at the data for months (even years) to find these relationships! However, it is also important to note the importance of domain knowledge. We help you start the conversation to discuss your data-driven findings with domain knowledge experts.
