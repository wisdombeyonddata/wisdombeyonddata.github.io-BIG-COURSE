## Hello World!

> In this lesson we will take the ideas from our exploratory analysis and turn them into hypothesis to test.

## Hypothesis Testing
Let's say we want to report on an increase in the number of employed people in this year as opposed to last year. How can we make such a conclusion?

### Null Hypothesis

H0: average in population is the same

### Alternative Hypothesis

H1: average housing price or average days employed across population is not the same (two way hypothesis, otherwise either increase or decrease)

`print('hello world)`

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('cleaned.csv')

test hypothesis
```

## Linear Regression
### Logistic Regression
### T Test

## Concluding Remarks
Next lesson, we will visualize these findings in a way that is interpretable. Data Storytelling :)
