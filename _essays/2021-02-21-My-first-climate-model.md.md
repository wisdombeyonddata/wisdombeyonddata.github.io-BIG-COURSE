Hello World! 

I have started taking [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-warming/) and decided to blog about my progress. :)

In this first blog, we take the solar energy that is radiated through space to a planet and set it equal to the infrared emissions from a planet to get the temperature on the planet.... or so we hope/think/try. In the app ([thank you, streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), you can see the estimated temperatures for a few planets and compare the model results to the actual temperature measured on these planets. 

> Happy Coding

As you can see, there is work to be done! Stay tuned :)
